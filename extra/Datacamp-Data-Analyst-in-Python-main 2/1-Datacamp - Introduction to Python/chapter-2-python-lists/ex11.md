#  Extend a list

```
Exercise ID 14266
```

##  Assignment 

If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]

```

You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the `areas` list?

##  Instructions 

- Use the `+` operator to paste the list `["poolhouse", 24.5]` to the end of the `areas` list. Store the resulting list as `areas_1`.
- Further extend `areas_1` by adding data on your garage. Add the string `"garage"` and float `15.45`. Name the resulting list `areas_2`.



```
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1


# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2

```

##  Hints 

- Follow the code sample in the assignment. `x` is `areas` here, and `["e", "f"]` is `["poolhouse", 24.5]`.
- To add more elements to `areas_1`, use `areas_1 + ["element", 123]`.



##  Solution 

```
# Create the areas list (updated version)
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]
```
