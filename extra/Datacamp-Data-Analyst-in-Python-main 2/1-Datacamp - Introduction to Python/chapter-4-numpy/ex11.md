#  Average versus median

```
Exercise ID 14290
```

##  Assignment 

You now know how to use `numpy` functions to get a better feeling for your data. It basically comes down to importing `numpy` and then calling several simple functions on the `numpy` arrays:

```
import numpy as np
x = [1, 4, 8, 10, 12]
np.mean(x)
np.median(x)

```

The baseball data is available as a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns (height, weight, age) and 1015 rows. The name of this `numpy` array is `np_baseball`. After restructuring the data, however, you notice that some height values are abnormally high. Follow the instructions and discover which summary statistic is best suited if you're dealing with so-called **outliers**. `np_baseball` is available.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
np_baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy()
np_baseball[slice(0, 1015, 50), 0] = np_baseball[slice(0, 1015, 50), 0]*1000
import numpy as np
```



##  Instructions 

- Create `numpy` array `np_height_in` that is equal to first column of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the mean of `np_height_in`.
- Print out the median of `np_height_in`.



```
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball


# Print out the mean of np_height_in


# Print out the median of np_height_in

```

##  Hints 

- Use 2D `numpy` subsetting: `[:,0]` is a part of the solution.
- If `numpy` is imported as `np`, you can use [`np.mean()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) to get the mean of a NumPy array. Don't forget to throw in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call.
- For the last instruction, use [`np.median()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html).



##  Solution 

```
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball
np_height_in = np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height_in
print(np.mean(np_height_in))

# Print out the median of np_height_in
print(np.median(np_height_in))
```
