#  NumPy Side Effects

```
Exercise ID 14283
```

##  Assignment 

As Hugo explained before, `numpy` is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, `numpy` arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elements' types are changed to end up with a homogeneous list. This is known as **type coercion**.

Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` have a different meaning for regular Python lists and `numpy` arrays.

Have a look at this line of code:

```
np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])

```

Can you tell which code chunk builds the exact same Python object? The `numpy` package is already imported as `np`, so you can start experimenting in the IPython Shell straight away!

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import numpy as np
```



##  Answers 
1. `np.array([True, 1, 2, 3, 4, False])`
1. `np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])`
1. `np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])`
1. `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`


##  Hints 

Copy the different code chunks and paste them in the IPython Shell. See which output matches the one generated by `np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])`.



##  Solution
