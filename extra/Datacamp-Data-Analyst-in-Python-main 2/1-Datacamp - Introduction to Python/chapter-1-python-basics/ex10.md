#  Type conversion

```
Exercise ID 14047
```

##  Assignment 

Using the `+` operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

Suppose, for example, that you've calculated your savings want to summarize the results in a string.

To do this, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), to convert a value into a string. `str(savings)`, for example, will convert the integer `savings` to a string.

Similar functions such as [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) and [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) will help you convert Python values into any type.

##  Instructions 

- Hit **Run Code** to run the code. Try to understand the error message.
- Fix the code such that the printout runs without errors; use the function [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) to convert the variables `savings` and `total_savings` to strings.
- Convert the variable `pi_string` to a float and store this float as a new variable, `pi_float`.



```
# Definition of savings and total_savings
savings = 100
total_savings = 150

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + total_savings + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float

```

##  Hints 

- The error message when you **Run Code** for the first time is telling you that you have an error in line 6 where at least one of your variables is not a string.
- You should use [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) twice!
- Use [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) on `pi_string` and store the result in `pi_float`.



##  Solution 

```
# Definition of savings and total_savings
savings = 100
total_savings = 150

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(total_savings) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
```
