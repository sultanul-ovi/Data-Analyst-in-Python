#  The Python Interface

```
Exercise ID 14023
```

##  Assignment 

Hit **Run Code** to run your first Python code with Datacamp and see the output!

Notice the `script.py` window; this is where you can type Python code to solve exercises. You can hit **Run Code** and **Submit Answer** as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click **Get Hint**, and ultimately **Get Solution**.

You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by typing commands and hitting Enter. Here, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.

##  Instructions 

- Experiment in the IPython Shell; type `5 / 8`, for example.
- Add another line of code to `script.py`, `print(7 + 10)`, to be checked for correctness.
- Hit **Submit Answer** to execute the Python script and receive feedback.



```
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Print the sum of 7 and 10
____
```

##  Hints 

- Add `print(7 + 10)` under `# Print the sum of 7 and 10` and hit **Submit Answer** to check if your code is correct.



##  Solution 

```
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)
```
