## What I Accomplished

Through this project, I gained proficiency in key Python concepts and tools, including:

- **Data Visualization**: Created impactful plots and charts using libraries like `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to communicate data insights effectively.
- **Dictionaries and Pandas**: Leveraged Python dictionaries and `Pandas` for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration.
- **Control Flow**: Applied logic and conditional statements to filter data and automate decision-making processes.
- **Loops**: Mastered iteration with `for` and `while` loops, including nested structures for efficiency.
- **Case Study: Hacker Statistics**: Built a simulation project using `NumPy` to model random processes and analyze statistical results.
