#  Select the valid list

```
Exercise ID 14256
```

##  Assignment 

A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list! Python is getting funkier by the minute, but fear not, just remember the list syntax:

```
my_list = [el1, el2, el3]

```

Can you tell which ones of the following lines of Python code are valid ways to build a list?

A. `[1, 3, 4, 2]`
B. `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 7]]`
C. `[1 + 2, "a" * 5, 3]`

##  Answers 
1. A, B and C
1. B
1. B and C
1. C


##  Hints 

Try out all the different lines in the Python shell and see which ones generate an error. Maybe none of them go wrong?
