#  Explore the baseball data

```
Exercise ID 14291
```

##  Assignment 

Because the mean and median are so far apart, you decide to complain to the MLB. They find the error and send the corrected data over to you. It's again available as a 2D NumPy array `np_baseball`, with three columns.

The Python script in the editor already includes code to print out informative messages with the different summary statistics. Can you finish the job? `np_baseball` is available.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
np_baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy()
import numpy as np
```



##  Instructions 

- The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Use [`np.std()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) on the first column of `np_baseball` to calculate `stddev`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Do big players tend to be heavier? Use [`np.corrcoef()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html) to store the correlation between the first and second column of `np_baseball` in `corr`. Replace `None` with the correct code.



```
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = None
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = None
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = None
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```

##  Hints 

- Use [`np.median()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html) to calculate the median. Make sure to select to correct column first!
- Subset the same column when calculating the standard deviation with [`np.std()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html).
- Use `np_baseball[:, 0]` and `np_baseball[:, 1]` to select the first and second columns; these are the inputs to [`np.corrcoef()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html).



##  Solution 

```
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0], np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```
