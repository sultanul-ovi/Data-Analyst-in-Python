#  2D Arithmetic

```
Exercise ID 14289
```

##  Assignment 

Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? `numpy` was able to perform all calculations element-wise (i.e. element by element). For 2D `numpy` arrays this isn't any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.

Execute the code below in the IPython shell and see if you understand:

```
import numpy as np
np_mat = np.array([[1, 2],
                   [3, 4],
                   [5, 6]])
np_mat * 2
np_mat + np.array([10, 10])
np_mat + np_mat

```

`np_baseball` is coded for you; it's again a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns representing height (in inches), weight (in pounds) and age (in years). `baseball` is available as a regular list of lists and `updated` is available as 2D numpy array.

##  Pre exercise code 

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
baseball = pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")[['Height', 'Weight', 'Age']].to_numpy().tolist()
n = len(baseball)
updated = np.array(pd.read_csv("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/update.csv", header = None))
import numpy as np
```



##  Instructions 

- You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D `numpy` array, `updated`. Add `np_baseball` and `updated` and print out the result.
- You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms, respectively). As a first step, create a `numpy` array with three values: `0.0254`, `0.453592` and `1`. Name this array `conversion`.
- Multiply `np_baseball` with `conversion` and print out the result.



```
# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated


# Create numpy array: conversion


# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion

```

##  Hints 

- `np_baseball + updated` will do an element-wise summation of the two `numpy` arrays.
- Create a `numpy` array with [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array); the input is a regular Python list with three elements.
- `np_baseball * conversion` will work, without extra work. Try out it! Make sure to wrap it in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call.



##  Solution 

```
# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball * conversion)
```
