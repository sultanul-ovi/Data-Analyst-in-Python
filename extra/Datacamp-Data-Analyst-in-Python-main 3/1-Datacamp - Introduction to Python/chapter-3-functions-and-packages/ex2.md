##  Assignment 

Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help). In IPython specifically, you can also use `?` before the function name.

To get help on the [`max()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

```
help(max)
?max

```

Use the IPython Shell to open up the documentation on [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow). Which of the following statements is true?

##  Answers 
1. `pow()` takes three arguments: `base`, `exp`, and `mod`. If you don't specify `mod`, the function will return an error.
1. `pow()` takes three arguments: `base`, `exp`, and `None`. All of these arguments are required.
1. `pow()` takes three arguments: `base`, `exp`, and `mod`. `base` and `exp` are required arguments, `mod` is an optional argument.
1. `pow()` takes two arguments: `exp` and `mod`. If you don't specify `exp`, the function will return an error.


##  Hints 

- Optional arguments are set `=` to a default value, which the function will use if that argument is not specified.



##  Solution 

No solution was found.
