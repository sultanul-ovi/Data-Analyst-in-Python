#  Calculations with variables

```
Exercise ID 13726
```

##  Assignment 

You've now created a savings variable, so let's start saving!

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The `savings` variable you created in the previous exercise with a value of `100` is available to you.

How much money would you have saved four months from now, if you saved $10 each month?

##  Pre exercise code 

```
savings = 100
```



##  Instructions 

- Create a variable `monthly_savings`, equal to `10` and `num_months`, equal to `4`.
- Multiply `monthly_savings` by `num_months` and save it to `new_savings`.
- Add `new_savings` to `savings`, saving the sum as `total_savings`.
- Print the value of `total_savings`.



```
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months



# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = ____

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = ____

# Print total_savings

```

##  Hints 

- You can do calculations with variables the same way as with numbers so instead of `10 * 4`, replace the numbers with the variables!
- Use `print()` to see the amount in `total_savings`.



##  Solution 

```
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings

# Print total_savings
print(total_savings)
```
