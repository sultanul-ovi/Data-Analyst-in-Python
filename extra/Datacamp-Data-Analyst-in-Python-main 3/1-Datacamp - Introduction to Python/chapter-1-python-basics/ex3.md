#  Any comments?

```
Exercise ID 14025
```

##  Assignment 

You can also add **comments** to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about and do not run as Python code.

They start with `#` tag. See the comment in the editor, `# Division`; now it's your turn to add a comment!

##  Instructions 

Above the `print(7 + 10)`, add the comment 

```
# Addition

```



```
# Division
print(5 / 8)

____
print(7 + 10)
```

##  Hints 

- For this exercise you only have to add one line of comments. It won't run as Python code. Add `# Addition` right above `print(7 + 10)`.



##  Solution 

```
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)
```
