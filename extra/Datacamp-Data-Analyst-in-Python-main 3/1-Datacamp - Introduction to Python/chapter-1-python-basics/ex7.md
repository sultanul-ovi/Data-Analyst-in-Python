#  Other variable types

```
Exercise ID 14044
```

##  Assignment 

In the previous exercise, you worked with the integer Python data type:

- `int`, or integer: a number without a fractional part. `savings`, with the value `100`, is an example of an integer.

Next to numerical data types, there are three other very common data types:

- `float`, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. `1.1`, is an example of a float.
- `str`, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
- `bool`, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. It can only be `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!).

##  Instructions 

- Create a new float, `half`, with the value `0.5`.
- Create a new string, `intro`, with the value `"Hello! How are you?"`.
- Create a new boolean, `is_good`, with the value `True`.



```
# Create a variable half


# Create a variable intro


# Create a variable is_good

```

##  Hints 

- To create a variable in Python, use `=`. Make sure to wrap your string in single or double quotes.
- Only two boolean values exist in Python: `True` and `False`. `TRUE`, `true`, `FALSE`, `false` and other versions will not be accepted.



##  Solution 

```
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True
```
