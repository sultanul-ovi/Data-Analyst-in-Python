#  Guess the type

```
Exercise ID 14347
```

##  Assignment 

To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) function. Suppose you've defined a variable `a`, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of `a`, simply execute:

```
type(a)

```

We already went ahead and created three variables: `a`, `b` and `c`. You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

##  Pre exercise code 

```
a = 100*0.5
b = "True"
c = False
```



##  Answers 
1. `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
1. `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`
1. `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
1. `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`


##  Hints 

Use `type(a)`, `type(b)` and `type(c)` inside the IPython Shell to find out about the variables' types.
