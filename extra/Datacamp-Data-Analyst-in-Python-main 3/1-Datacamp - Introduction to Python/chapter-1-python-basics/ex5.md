Exercise ID 14043
```

##  Assignment 

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable `x` with a value of `5`, you use `=`, like this example:

```
x = 5

```

You can now use the name of this variable, `x`, instead of the actual value, `5`.

Remember, `=` in Python means **assignment**, it doesn't test equality!

##  Pre exercise code 

```
 
```



##  Instructions 

- Create a variable `savings` with the value of `100`.
- Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.



```
# Create a variable savings


# Print out savings

```

##  Hints 

- Type `savings = 100` to create the variable `savings`.
- After creating the variable `savings`, you can type `print(savings)`.



##  Solution 

```
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```
